🎵 GymTunes: Your Personal Workout DJ 🏋️‍♂️
Ever been to the gym, all pumped up, only to realize you forgot your playlist? 😱 We've all been there! That's exactly why I created GymTunes. As a gym-goer who's experienced the music-less workout struggle firsthand, I knew there had to be a better way.

🤔 The Problem
Picture this: You're ready to crush your workout, you've got your water bottle, your towel, and your game face on. But as soon as you start your first set, you realize... silence. 😶 No beats, no rhythm, just the clanking of weights and the hum of treadmills. Without your perfect playlist, that workout energy just isn't the same.

💡 The Solution: GymTunes
That's where GymTunes comes in! It's not just an app; it's your personal DJ that understands your workout vibes. Here's what it does:

🎭 You tell it your mood: Feeling fierce for some heavy lifting? Or maybe you need some chill beats for yoga? Just let GymTunes know!
⏰ You share your gym time: Early bird or night owl? No problem. Just tell the app when you're hitting the gym.
🎶 It picks the perfect playlist: Using the power of Spotify, GymTunes finds a random playlist that matches your mood. Angry punk for leg day? Smooth jazz for stretching? You got it!
📅 It syncs with your Google Calendar: The chosen playlist is added as an event in your calendar. So when it's gym o'clock, your tunes are ready and waiting!
🛠️ Under the Hood
You might be wondering, "How did you pull this off?" Well, I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast, so I combined some cool tools:

Composio & Cohere: These AI wizards help GymTunes talk to your Google Calendar. They understand your schedule and make sure your playlist is there when you need it.
Spotipy: This is our music maestro. It dives into Spotify's massive library to find playlists that match your current state of mind.
Streamlit: The face of our app. It makes sure GymTunes is easy to use, whether you're a tech guru or just someone who loves a good workout.
🌟 Why I Made This
As a developer, I love solving problems. But as a gym-goer, I really love my workout playlists. When I realized I could use my coding skills to solve a problem that bugged me daily, it was a no-brainer.

GymTunes isn't just about convenience; it's about making sure every workout is as epic as it should be. Because let's be real: the right music can turn a good session into a legendary one. 🎧🔥
